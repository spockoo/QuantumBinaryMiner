Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+: Download from python.org.
Pip: Python package manager, usually included with Python.
Bazel: Build tool for TensorFlow. Download from bazel.build.
TensorFlow: Install TensorFlow via pip.
Cirq: Install Cirq via pip.
Scikit-learn: Install scikit-learn via pip.
Matplotlib: Install matplotlib via pip.
To install required Python packages, use:

bash
Copier le code
pip install tensorflow cirq scikit-learn matplotlib keras-tuner
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/quantum-tensorflow-project.git
cd quantum-tensorflow-project
Install Dependencies

Make sure to install all the required Python packages. Use the following command:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Bazel

Ensure Bazel is installed and correctly configured. Follow the installation instructions from Bazel's website.

Configuration
TensorFlow GPU Configuration (Optional)

If using a GPU, make sure you have the correct GPU drivers and CUDA installed. Configure TensorFlow to use the GPU by setting memory growth:

python
Copier le code
physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
if physical_devices:
    try:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error configuring GPU: {e}")
Miner Configuration

Update the following constants in the code with your miner's path and settings:

MINER_PATH: Path to the miner executable.
POOL_URL: URL of the mining pool.
USER: Your mining username.
PASSWORD: Your mining password.
python
Copier le code
MINER_PATH = "C:/path/to/miner"
MINER_EXECUTABLE = "miner.exe"
POOL_URL = "stratum+tcp://pool.example.com:port"
USER = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"
Usage
Run the Main Script

Execute the main script to start the mining process, model training, and visualization:

bash
Copier le code
python your_main_script.py
This script will start mining, train the TensorFlow model, simulate quantum circuits, and display real-time graphs.

Monitor and Analyze

Real-time graphs will be displayed using Matplotlib, showing model performance metrics and quantum simulation results.

RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error of the model.
Intercept: Intercept of the model.
Intercept Adjusted: Adjusted intercept for comparison.
Quantum Circuit Results: Histogram of quantum circuit simulation results.
Sample vs Actual Values: Plot showing actual vs. predicted values.
R^2 Score: Coefficient of Determination.
Stop Mining

To stop the mining process, use a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C). The script will handle stopping the miner and logging the end time.

Features
TensorFlow Model Training: Hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning of models.
Quantum Simulation: Creation and execution of quantum circuits with Cirq.
Data Collection: Integration with a miner for collecting data.
Visualization: Real-time graphs for performance metrics and quantum results.
